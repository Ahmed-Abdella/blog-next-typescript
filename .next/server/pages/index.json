If your page has dynamic routes then getStaticPaths should be used along with getStaticProps.\n\nBut if your website contains a page whose data changes very frequently then you must use getServerSideProps as it fetches fresh data on every request.\n\n**Example:** We will build a simple Next Js application with three pages of albums, posts, and a users page with dynamic routes. All three pages will implement different data fetching methods. For this example, we will use [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) API to fetch random data.\n\nRun the following command to create a new Next Js application (Make sure you have NPM and node installed) :\n\n```bash\nnpm install react-router-dom npm install react-router-dom\n```\n\nWhen we open our project in a code editor, we see a straightforward project structure.

It is used to implement Static Site Generation and Incremental Site Regeneration.\n\n**Properties of getStaticProps:**\n\n- It can only be exported from the page file, not the component file.\n- It only runs on build time.\n- It runs on every subsequent request in development mode.\n- Its code is completely excluded from the client-side bundle.\n\n### Fetching Data In Next.js App\n\n**getStaticPaths:** If a page uses getStaticProps and has dynamic routes, it must declare a list of paths that will be statically generated. Next.js will statically pre-render all the paths defined by getStaticPaths when we export a function named getStaticPaths from a page.\n\n**Properties of getStaticPaths:**\n\n- It can only be exported from a page file.\n- It is meant for dynamic routes.\n- Page must also implement getStaticProps.\n- It runs only at build time in production.\n- It runs on every request in development mode.\n\n**getServerSideProps:** It will pre-render the page on every subsequent request. It is slower as compared to getStaticProps as the page is being rendered on every request. getServerSideProps props return JSON which will be used to render the page all this work will be handled automatically by Next.js. It could be used for calling a CMS, database, or other APIs directly from getServerSideProps.

If your page has dynamic routes then getStaticPaths should be used along with getStaticProps.\n\nBut if your website contains a page whose data changes very frequently then you must use getServerSideProps as it fetches fresh data on every request.\n\n**Example:** We will build a simple Next Js application with three pages of albums, posts, and a users page with dynamic routes. All three pages will implement different data fetching methods. For this example, we will use [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) API to fetch random data.\n\nRun the following command to create a new Next Js application (Make sure you have NPM and node installed) :\n\n```bash\nnpm install react-router-dom npm install react-router-dom\n```\n\nWhen we open our project in a code editor, we see a straightforward project structure. For the scope of this tutorial, we will only focus on /pages directory. We’ll first cleanup the /pages/index.js file.

It is used to implement Static Site Generation and Incremental Site Regeneration.\n\n**Properties of getStaticProps:**\n\n- It can only be exported from the page file, not the component file.\n- It only runs on build time.\n- It runs on every subsequent request in development mode.\n- Its code is completely excluded from the client-side bundle.\n\n### Fetching Data In Next.js App\n\n**getStaticPaths:** If a page uses getStaticProps and has dynamic routes, it must declare a list of paths that will be statically generated. Next.js will statically pre-render all the paths defined by getStaticPaths when we export a function named getStaticPaths from a page.\n\n**Properties of getStaticPaths:**\n\n- It can only be exported from a page file.\n- It is meant for dynamic routes.\n- Page must also implement getStaticProps.\n- It runs only at build time in production.\n- It runs on every request in development mode.\n\n**getServerSideProps:** It will pre-render the page on every subsequent request. It is slower as compared to getStaticProps as the page is being rendered on every request. getServerSideProps props return JSON which will be used to render the page all this work will be handled automatically by Next.js. It could be used for calling a CMS, database, or other APIs directly from getServerSideProps.

If your page has dynamic routes then getStaticPaths should be used along with getStaticProps.\n\nBut if your website contains a page whose data changes very frequently then you must use getServerSideProps as it fetches fresh data on every request.\n\n**Example:** We will build a simple Next Js application with three pages of albums, posts, and a users page with dynamic routes. All three pages will implement different data fetching methods. For this example, we will use [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) API to fetch random data.\n\nRun the following command to create a new Next Js application (Make sure you have NPM and node installed) :\n\n```bash\nnpm install react-router-dom npm install react-router-dom\n```\n\nWhen we open our project in a code editor, we see a straightforward project structure. For the scope of this tutorial, we will only focus on /pages directory. We’ll first cleanup the /pages/index.js file.
